Exterior
The Krusty Krab building has a wooden chassis with glass windows/walls and appears from the outside as an old lobster trap.
 There is a large clam-shaped sign in front of the restaurant, similar to those used by real-life fast food restaurants, and five international maritime signal flags above the front door.
  There is a pole outside its right window as seen in the episode "My Pretty Seahorse." It shares a resemblance to a New England lobster trap. 
  It might have just been built to look like a lobster trap, but it is also possible that it was actually formed from an old sunken lobster trap. -->

            The reason the restaurant is so popular is because of the Krabby Patty, a burger with a very top secret recipe, which has almost always been the signature Krusty Krab dish.
             Other Krusty Krab grub includes typical fast food products such as french fries and sodas.
             Our signature burgers, the Krabby Patty, is comically beloved by the citizens of Bikini Bottom.
             All of these items make up the Galley Grub, the food menu of the Krusty Krab. <br> <br>
             At KrustyKrab's, we're passionate about our food. We take great care that what we serve every day is safe, great quality, offers choice and is produced in a responsible way.
              That means we use 100% pure meat patties seasoned with just a pinch of salt and pepper. 
               And, our Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made with whitefish sourced from sustainably managed wild-caught fisheries.
               It means our Chicken Nuggets are made with white meat chicken. Simply put, it means we’re committed to always evolving what matters to you.
